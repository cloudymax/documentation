# Self-Hosting

Projects often encounter a constraint or requirement which make free-tier hosted CI/CD instances
insufficient for their needs. In these cases hosting your own CI/CD runner can be a viable solution
to premium-tier services or subscriptions. Self-hosting may also provide access to resources that
are simply not available on many CI/CD services such as GPUs, faster drives, and newer CPU models.

There are many ways to self-host CI/CD runners, and which one is best for you will depend on your on
situation and constraints. For the purpose of this guide we will make the following assumptions:

- User already has their own hardware üíª
- Budget is $0 üí∏
- FOSS tools should be prioritized where possible üõ†Ô∏è
- We define `Self-Hosting` in this context to refer to a user taking responsibilty for the
  operating-system level configuration and life-cycle-management of a given compute resource (metal,
  on-prem, cloud VM, VPS etc...) üìú

## Requirements

This guide is tested for compatibility on devics which meet the following requirements:

- x86 or amd64 processor
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Server or Debian 12 Bookworm
- root access
- Network connectivity
- Nvidia GPU (required for GPU Acceleration)

## Finding a Host

The "Host" is the computer which will execute the runner program. This can be a desktop computer,
laptop, Virtual Machine, or VPS from a cloud provider. If your host is cloud-instance then the OS
and admin user should already exist. Move on to the provisioning section for further instructions.
If your host is a local machine, perform a clean installation of the operating system using the
following guides:

Ubuntu:

- Download the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS server installer
  [HERE](https://ftp.snt.utwente.nl/pub/os/linux/ubuntu-releases/22.04.3/ubuntu-22.04.3-live-server-amd64.iso)
- [Install Ubuntu 22.04 LTS on a local machine](https://ostechnix.com/install-ubuntu-server/)

Debian:

- Download the Debain 12 installer
  [HERE](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-dvd/debian-12.1.0-amd64-DVD-1.iso)
- [Install Debian on a local system](https://www.linuxtechi.com/how-to-install-debian-11-bullseye/)

## Provisioning the Host

Once you can sign into your host, follow the appropriate guide to complete the provisioning process.
Note that the Nvidia driver and container-toolkit installation are only required for GPU
acceleration. Skip those steps if you do require that functionality.

- [Ubuntu 22.04 Setup](./ubuntu-setup)

- [Debian 12 Setup](./debian-setup)

## Splitting the Host

You may find yourself with the requirement for multiple runners, runners of differing
configurations, or different operating systems but only have access to a single Host. In this case,
you can split your Host into multiple runners using virtualization. If this applies to you, complete
the provisioning step and then follow the [Virtual Machines Guide](./virtual-machines).

## Installing the Runner Software

- [Github Actions](./github-actions)

- [GitLab Pipelines](./gitlab-pipelines)

- CircleCI (ToDo)

- Argo Workflows (ToDo)

- Jenkins (ToDo)

- Ansible/Semaphore/AWX (ToDo)

## Update Workflows
