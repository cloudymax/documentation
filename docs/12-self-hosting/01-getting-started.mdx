# Getting Started

There are many ways to self-host CI/CD runners Which way is most suitable for your needs will be
determined by the requirements of your project and the resources availble to you.

## Requirements

This guide is tested for compatibility on devics which meet the following requirements:

- x86 or amd64 processor
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Server or Debian 12 Bookworm
- root access
- Network connectivity
- Nvidia GPU (optional)

## Step 1: Creating a Host

The Host is the computer which will execute the runner program. This can be a desktop computer,
laptop, Virtual Machine, or VPS from a cloud provider. Choose the process that works best for your
situation. You are done when you are able to log-in to the host as a user with root access.

- For users with dedicated hardware available, perform a clean installation of the operating system
  of your choice using the following guides:

  - [Install Ubuntu 22.04 LTS on a local machine](https://ostechnix.com/install-ubuntu-server/)

  - [Install Debian on a local system](https://www.linuxtechi.com/how-to-install-debian-11-bullseye/)

- For users without dedicated hardware, a virtual host is the best solution. While there are many
  ways to create avirtual machine I advise using Multipass because it is specifically designed to
  create conformant Ubuntu Server VMs on almost any platform.

  - [Install Multipass](https://multipass.run/install)

  - [Create a Virtual Machine](https://multipass.run/docs/create-an-instance)

- For cloud-based deployments, refer to the following guides for deploying runners as spot instances
  using Terraform and Cloud-Init:

  - [AWS guide](https://github.com/buildstar-online/modules-aws-ec2)

  - [GCP guide](https://github.com/buildstar-online/gcp-tf-starter)

  - [Azure guide](https://github.com/buildstar-online/azure-tf-starter)

  - [Equinix Metal](https://github.com/buildstar-online/modules-equinix-tf-spot)

## Step 2: Provisioning the Host

Once you can sign into your host, follow the appropriate guide to complete the provisioning process.

- [Ubuntu 22.04 Setup](./ubuntu-setup)

- [Debian 12 Setup](./debian-setup)

## Step 2: Install the Runner Software

- github

- gitlab

- circleci

## Step 3: Update Workflows
