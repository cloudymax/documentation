# Github Actions

The Github actions runner application supports many different installation and configuration
options. This guide covers on a basic setup that creates a single runner instance. Both manual and
automated setup instructions are provided, skip to the bottom of the page for the automation script.

For more in-depth guidance please refer to the official documentation:

- [About self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)
- [Hosting your own runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners)
- [Using self-hosted runners in a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/using-self-hosted-runners-in-a-workflow)

## Manual Setup

1. Log in to [Github](https://github.com/) and navigate to the repo you would like to set up a
   runner for and from the top menu of the repo's page, select the `settings` tab

</div>
<br />
<br />

2. From them menu on the left, expand the `Actions` menu then select the `Runners` option

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src={ActionsTab} width="700" />
</div>
<br />
<br />

3. Click the `New self-hosted runner` button to bring up the runner installation instructions.

  <img src={NewRunner} width="700" />
</div>
<br />
<br />

4. Select the `Linux` runner option, then follow the on-screen instructions to download, install,
   and configure the runner application.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src={RunnerSettings} width="700" />
</div>
<br />

5. Update your workflow file to use your self hosted runner by setting the `runs-on` valueto
   `self-hosted` as shown in the example below.

   ```yaml
   name: learn-github-actions
   on: [push]
   jobs:
     check-bats-version:
       runs-on: self-hosted
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
           with:
             node-version: '14'
         - run: npm install -g bats
         - run: bats -v
   ```

## Automated Setup

The following script will perform the same actions as described above automatically. This is usefull
for those who would prefer ephemeral runners or to use a declarative workflow. You will need to
provide your own access-token to the script as an input value.

1. Copy and paste the following int your terminal to create the script

   ```bash
   /usr/bin/cat << 'EOF' > runner.sh
   #!/bin/bash

   # url for github api endpoint
   base_api_url="https://api.github.com"

   # Username or Org name
   owner=$1

   # Name of the repository to create a runner for
   repo=$2

   # Access token
   token=$3

   # Runner platform
   runner_plat=linux

   # Get a authorized token for your repo/org
   export RUNNER_TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST ${base_api_url}/repos/${owner}/${repo}/actions/runners/registration-token -H "accept: application/vnd.github.everest-preview+json" -H "authorization: token ${token}" | jq -r '.token')

   # Find the latest version of the runner software
   latest_version_label=$(curl -s -X GET 'https://api.github.com/repos/actions/runner/releases/latest' | jq -r '.tag_name')
   latest_version=$(echo ${latest_version_label:1})

   # Assemble the string-value for the runner application archive
   runner_file="actions-runner-${runner_plat}-x64-${latest_version}.tar.gz"

   # Assemble the download URL
   runner_url="https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/${latest_version_label}/${runner_file}"

   # Download and extract the archive
   wget -O ${runner_file} ${runner_url}
   tar xzf "./${runner_file}"

   # Install and configure the application without prompting for user-input
   ./config.sh --url https://github.com/${owner}/${repo} --token ${RUNNER_TOKEN} --unattended

   ./svc.sh install
   sudo ./svc.sh start
   sudo ./svc.sh status
   EOF
   ```

2. Run the script as follows:

   ```bash
   bash ./runner.sh <github-username> <repo-name> <access-token>
   ```
