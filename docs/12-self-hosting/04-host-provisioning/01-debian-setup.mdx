# Debian Machine Setup

Steps for manual configuration and provisioning of Debian 12 server systems. These steps will also
upgrade a Debain 11 system to Debian 12. This guide assumes and recommends that the user is starting
from a fresh installation. If you unfamiliar with the installation process for Debian, see the links
below before progressing.

- [How to Install Debian](https://www.linuxtechi.com/how-to-install-debian-11-bullseye/)

- [Debian 12 ISO Image](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/weekly-builds/amd64/iso-dvd/debian-testing-amd64-DVD-1.iso)

## Base Packages

- Log in to your host as the root user

- Add required the apt sources and upgrade your system to the latest version.

  ```bash
  cat << EOF > /etc/apt/sources.list
  deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
  deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm main contrib non-free non-free-firmware

  deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-security/ bookworm-security main contrib non-free
  deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian-security/ bookworm-security main contrib non-free

  deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-updates main contrib non-free
  deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-updates main contrib non-free
  EOF
  ```

- Apply system updates and upgrades

  Update the package list and upgrade system components prior to installing other software. Reboot
  after the process completes.

  ```bash
  # run as root
  apt-get update && \
  apt-get upgrade -y && \
  apt-get full-upgrade -y

  reboot
  ```

- Install base utilities

  The following is a curated set of base packages that are dependencies for steps later in the guide
  and helpful in general.

  ```bash
  # Run as root
  apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y wireguard \
    ssh-import-id \
    sudo \
    curl \
    tmux \
    netplan.io \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    software-properties-common \
    htop \
    git-extras \
    rsyslog \
    fail2ban \
    vim \
    gpg \
    open-iscsi \
    nfs-common \
    ncdu \
    zip \
    unzip \
    iotop && \
    sudo wget https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/latest/download/yq_linux_amd64 -O /usr/bin/yq && \
    sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/yq && \
    sudo systemctl enable fail2ban && \
    sudo systemctl start fail2ban
  ```

## Setup the admin user

- Create the user

  ```bash
  export NEW_USER="<some new user here>"
  useradd -s /bin/bash -d /home/$NEW_USER/ -m -G sudo $NEW_USER
  ```

- Grant passwordless sudo permission

  ```bash
  echo "$NEW_USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
  ```

- Import an ssh key

  If you have a GitHub, GitLab, or Launchpad account, you can use `ssh-import-id` to install you ssh
  public-key into your host.

  - [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account?platform=linux)
  - [Use SSH keys to communicate with GitLab ](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/ssh.html)
  - [launchpad.net](https://launchpad.net/)

  If you do not have one of the above, you can always upload your key manually as described in
  [SSH Copy ID for Copying SSH Keys to Servers](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/copy-id) from
  [ssh.com](https://www.ssh.com).

  Example usage for `ssh-import-id`:

  ```bash
  # GitHub
  sudo -u $NEW_USER ssh-import-id-gh <github username>

  # GitLab
  URL="https://gitlab.exampledomain.com/%s.keys" sudo -u $NEW_USER ssh-import-id <gitlab username>
  ```

- Add the user to relevant groups

  ```bash
  usermod -a -G kvm $NEW_USER
  ```

- Create a password for the user

  ```bash
  passwd $NEW_USER
  ```

## Install Docker

- Download the docker GPG key

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | \
  sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
  ```

- Add the apt package source

  ```bash
  echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
  ```

- Update the apt package list and install Docker

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce
  ```

- Add the user to the docker group

  ```bash
  usermod -a -G docker $NEW_USER
  ```

## install Docker Compose (Optional)

The default apt package lists provide a very outdated version of docker compose. Below are the steps
required to install a current version.

- Find the latest version by visiting https://github.com/docker/compose/releases

  ```bash
  export COMPOSE_VERSION="2.17.3"
  ```

- Create a directory for the binary

  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins/
  ```

- Download the binary

  ```bash
  curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v$COMPOSE_VERSION/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose
  ```

- Make it executable

  ```bash
  chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose
  ```

## Install NVIDIA GPU Drivers (Optional)

Debian's built-in driver installation process is more reliable than Ubuntu's, but readers are still
advised to get their driver installaer directly from NVIDIA. Instructions for apt installation are
included for completeness.

### Download and Install from Nvidia

- Install required packages

  ```bash
  # Run as root
  apt-get install -y gcc \
  firmware-misc-nonfree \
  linux-headers-amd64 \
  linux-headers-`uname -r`
  ```

- Find your driver version and download the installer

  You can find both gaming and data-center drivers using the Nvidia web tool, however cloud and vps
  users will need to refer to their provider's documentation for installation instructions as many
  providers will require you to use GRID drivers instead.

  - Nvidia's web tool: https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx.

  Alternatively, you can download a specific driver version using curl:

  ```bash
  export DRIVER_VERSION=""

  # GeForce Cards
  curl --progress-bar -fL -O "https://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/$DRIVER_VERSION/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-$DRIVER_VERSION.run"

  # Datacenter Cards
  curl --progress-bar -fL -O "https://us.download.nvidia.com/tesla/$DRIVER_VERSION/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-$DRIVER_VERSION.run"
  ```

- Run the Installer

  It is required to run the driver from the system console, it cannot be installed from an
  X-session. If you used a desktop image instead of a server image you will need to disable your
  session manager.

  ```bash
  sudo bash "NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-*.run"
  ```

### Download and Install from Apt

Will not work for data-center cards or hosts which require GRID drivers.

```bash
sudo apt-get install nvidia-driver
```

## Install the Nvidia Container Toolkit (Optional)

The Nvidia Container Toolkit allows contains to access the GPU resources of the underlying host
machine. Requires that the GPU drivers are already installed on the host. See the official docs
here: https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html

- Set your system distribution name to Debian 11 as workaround until Nvidia adds official Debian 12
  support

  ```bash
  distribution=debian11
  ```

- Download the gpg key and add the repo to your apt sources

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg \
  && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/$distribution/libnvidia-container.list | \
      sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' | \
      sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list
  ```

- Update apt packages and install the container toolkit

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
  ```

- Set `nvidia` the default container runtime

  ```bash
  sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker --set-as-default
  ```

- Restart the docker service

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart docker
  ```

- Test that it is working

  Run one of Nvidia's
  [sample workloads](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/sample-workload.html)
  to test system functionality.

## Install the Prometheus metrics exporter (Optional)

- Log in as, or assume the root user.

- Download the metrics exporter application

  ```bash
  wget -O /opt/node_exporter-1.6.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.6.1/node_exporter-1.6.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz && \
  ```

- Extract the archive and copy into place

  ```bash
  tar -xvf /opt/node_exporter-1.6.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /opt && \
  rm /opt/node_exporter-1.6.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz && \
  ln -s node_exporter-1.6.1.linux-amd64 /opt/node_exporter
  ```

- Download and create the system service

  ```bash
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/small-hack/smol-metal/main/node-exporter.service && \
  sudo mv node-exporter.service /etc/systemd/system/node-exporter.service && \
  systemctl daemon-reload && \
  systemctl enable node-exporter && \
  systemctl restart node-exporter
  ```
