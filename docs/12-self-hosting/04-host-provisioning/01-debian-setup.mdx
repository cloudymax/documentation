# Debian Machine Setup

Steps for manual configuration and provisioning of Debian 12 server systems. These steps will also
upgrade a Debain 11 system to Debian 12. This guide assumes and recommends that the user is starting
from a fresh installation. If you unfamiliar with the installation process for Debian, see the links
below before progressing.

- [How to Install Debian](https://www.linuxtechi.com/how-to-install-debian-11-bullseye/)

- [Debian 12 ISO Image](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/weekly-builds/amd64/iso-dvd/debian-testing-amd64-DVD-1.iso)

## Base Packages

### 1. Log in to your host as the root user

### 2. Add required the apt sources and upgrade your system to the latest version.

```bash
cat << EOF > /etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm main contrib non-free non-free-firmware

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-security/ bookworm-security main contrib non-free
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian-security/ bookworm-security main contrib non-free

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-updates main contrib non-free
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-updates main contrib non-free
EOF
```

### 3. Apply system updates and upgrades

Update the package list and upgrade system components prior to installing other software. Reboot
after the process completes.

```bash
# run as root
apt-get update && \
apt-get upgrade -y && \
apt-get full-upgrade -y

reboot
```

### 4. Install base utilities

The following is a curated set of base packages that are dependencies for steps later in the guide
and helpful in general.

```bash
# Run as root
apt-get update && \
  apt-get install -y wireguard \
  openresolv \
  ssh-import-id \
  sudo \
  curl \
  tmux \
  netplan.io \
  apt-transport-https \
  ca-certificates \
  software-properties-common \
  htop \
  git-extras \
  rsyslog \
  fail2ban \
  vim \
  gpg \
  open-iscsi \
  nfs-common \
  ncdu \
  iotop && \
  sudo wget https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/latest/download/yq_linux_amd64 -O /usr/bin/yq && \
  sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/yq && \
  sudo systemctl enable fail2ban && \
  sudo systemctl start fail2ban
```

## Setup the admin user

### 1. Create the user

```bash
export NEW_USER="<some new user here>"
useradd -s /bin/bash -d /home/$NEW_USER/ -m -G sudo $NEW_USER
```

### 2. Grant passwordless sudo permission

```bash
echo "$NEW_USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
```

### 3. Import an ssh key

- If you have a Github, GitLab, or Launchpad account, you can use `ssh-import-id` to install you ssh
  public-key into your host.

  - [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account?platform=linux)
  - [Use SSH keys to communicate with GitLab ](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/ssh.html)
  - [launchpad.net](https://launchpad.net/)

- If you do not have one of the above, you can always upload your key manually as described in
  [SSH Copy ID for Copying SSH Keys to Servers](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/copy-id) from
  [ssh.com](https://www.ssh.com).

Example usage for `ssh-import-id`:

```bash
# Github
sudo -u $NEW_USER ssh-import-id-gh <github username>

# Gitlab
URL="https://gitlab.exampledomain.com/%s.keys" sudo -u $NEW_USER ssh-import-id <gitlab username>
```

### 4. Add the user to relevant groups

```bash
usermod -a -G kvm $NEW_USER
usermod -a -G docker $NEW_USER
```

### 5. Create a password for the user

```bash
passwd $NEW_USER
```

### 6. Log out of the root account and log back in as the new user.

## Install Docker

### 1. Download the docker GPG key

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | \
sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```

### 2. Add the apt package source

```bash
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

### 3. Update the apt package list and install Docker

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce
```

## install Docker Compose (Optional)

The default apt package lists provide a very outdated version of docker compose. Below are the steps
required to install a current version.

### 1. Find the latest version by visiting https://github.com/docker/compose/releases

```bash
export COMPOSE_VERSION="2.17.3"
```

### 2. Create a directory for the binary

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins/
```

### 3. Download the binary

```bash
curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v$COMPOSE_VERSION/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose
```

### 4. Make it executable

```bash
chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose
```

## Install NVIDIA GPU Drivers (Optional)

Debian's built-in driver installation process is more reliable than Ubuntu's, but readers are still
advised to get their driver installaer directly from NVIDIA. Instructions for apt installation are
included for completeness.

### Download and Install from Nvidia

#### 1. Install required packages

```bash
# Run as root
apt-get install -y gcc \
firmware-misc-nonfree \
linux-headers-amd64 \
linux-headers-`uname -r`
```

#### 2. Find your driver version and download the installer

You can find both gaming and data-center drivers using the Nvidia web tool, however cloud and vps
users will need to refer to their provider's documentation for installation instructions as many
providers will require you to use GRID drivers instead.

- Nvidia's web tool: https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx.

- Alternatively, you can download a specific driver version using curl

```bash
export DRIVER_VERSION=""

# GeForce Cards
curl --progress-bar -fL -O "https://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/$DRIVER_VERSION/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-$DRIVER_VERSION.run"

# Datacenter Cards
curl --progress-bar -fL -O "https://us.download.nvidia.com/tesla/$DRIVER_VERSION/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-$DRIVER_VERSION.run"
```

#### 3. Run the Installer

It is required to run the driver from the system console, it cannot be installed from an X-session.
If you used a desktop image instead of a server image you will need to disable your session manager.

```bash
sudo bash "NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-*.run"
```

### Download and Install from Apt

This will not work for data-center cards or hosts which require GRID drivers.

```bash
sudo apt-get install nvidia-driver
```

## Install the Nvidia Container Toolkit (Optional)

The Nvidia Container Toolkit allows contains to access the GPU resources of the underlying host
machine. Requires that the GPU drivers are already installed on the host. See the official docs
here: https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html

### 1. Set your system distribution name to Debian 11 as workaround until Nvidia adds official Debian 12 support

```bash
distribution=debian11
```

### 2. Download the gpg key and add the repo to your apt sources

```bash
curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg \
&& curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/$distribution/libnvidia-container.list | \
    sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list
```

### 3. Update apt packages and install the container toolkit

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
```

### 4. Set `nvidia` the default container runtime

```bash
sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker --set-as-default
```

### 5. Restart the docker service

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### 6. Test that it is working

Run one of Nvidia's
[sample workloads](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/sample-workload.html)
to test system functionality.

## Install the Prometheus metrics exporter (Optional)

### 1. Log in as, or assume the root user.

### 2. Download the metrics exporter application

```bash
wget -O /opt/node_exporter-1.6.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.6.1/node_exporter-1.6.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz && \
```

### 3. Extract the archive and copy into place

```bash
tar -xvf /opt/node_exporter-1.6.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /opt && \
rm /opt/node_exporter-1.6.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz && \
ln -s node_exporter-1.6.1.linux-amd64 /opt/node_exporter
```

### 4. Download and create the system service

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/small-hack/smol-metal/main/node-exporter.service && \
sudo mv node-exporter.service /etc/systemd/system/node-exporter.service && \
systemctl daemon-reload && \
systemctl enable node-exporter && \
systemctl restart node-exporter
```
