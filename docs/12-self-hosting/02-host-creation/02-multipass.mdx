# VMs with Multipass (Basic)

Multipass is a light-weight Virtual Machine Manager for Linux, Windows and MacOS. It's designed for
developers who want to quickly create a fresh Ubuntu environment with a single command. It uses the
native hypervisor for whichever platform it is installed on (KVM on Linux, Hyper-V on Windows and
HyperKit on MacOS) to run VMs with minimal overhead. It can also use VirtualBox on Windows and
MacOS. The biggest limitation of Multipass is that it only creates Ubuntu VMs.

- [Official Github Repo](https://github.com/canonical/multipass)

## Installation

To install multipass on Linux use the commands below.

```bash
sudo apt-get install snapd
sudo snap install core
sudo snap install multipass
```

For installation on Windows and MacOS, refer to the official installation instructions:

- [How to install Multipass on Windows](https://multipass.run/docs/installing-on-windows)
- [How to install Multipass on MacOS](https://multipass.run/docs/installing-on-macos)

## Creating a VM

### 1. Set values

```bash
# The name of the Virtual Machine
export VM_NAME="gameci"

# The name of the user to create
export VM_USER="vmadmin"

# Number of CPU cores to allocate to the VM
export VM_CPUS="2"

# Amount of Disk Space to allocate to the VM.
# Cannot exceed available on host.
export VM_DISK="32G"

# Amount of RAM to allocate to the VM.
# Cannot exceed available RAM on host.
export VM_MEM="8G"

# Set path on MacOS systems
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin/multipass"

# Set path on Linux system
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin/multipass"
```

### 2. Create an ssh-key for authenticating with the VM

```bash
ssh-keygen -C $VM_USER -f runner
```

### 3. Add the public ssh-key to a cloud-init file

See the [cloud init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/examples.html) docs for more
examples.

```bash
VM_KEY=$(cat runner.pub)

cat << EOF > cloud-init.yaml
#cloud-config
groups:
  - docker
users:
  - default
  - name: ${VM_USER}
    sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
    shell: /bin/bash
    groups: docker, admin, sudo, users
    no_ssh_fingerprints: true
    ssh-authorized-keys:
      - ${VM_KEY}
packages:
  - docker.io
runcmd:
  - [ sed , -i , "s/#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password/PermitRootLogin no/g" , /etc/ssh/sshd_config ]
EOF
```

### 4. Start the VM

See the [multipass launch](https://multipass.run/docs/launch-command) command docs for more
information.

```bash
export VERBOSITY="-vvvvvv"

/snap/bin/multipass launch --name $VM_NAME \
  --cpus $VM_CPUS \
  --disk $VM_DISK \
  --mem $VM_MEM \
  --cloud-init cloud-init.yaml \
  $VERBOSITY
```

### 5. Get the VM's IP address

```bash
VM_IP=$(/snap/bin/multipass list |grep "${VM_NAME}" |awk '{print $3}')
```

### 6. Connect to the VM via ssh or cli

ssh:

```bash
ssh -i runner $VM_USER@$VM_IP -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -vvvv
```

CLI:

```bash
multipass shell $VM_NAME
```

### 7. Install the runner application

- [Gitlab Pipelines](../04-runner-application-installation/01-gitlab-pipelines.mdx)

## Cleanup

```bash
/snap/bin/multipass stop $VM_NAME
/snap/bin/multipass delete $VM_NAME
/snap/bin/multipass purge
```
