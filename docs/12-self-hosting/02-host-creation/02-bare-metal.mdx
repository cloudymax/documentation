The Host is the computer that will execute the runner appication. This can be a desktop computer,
laptop, Virtual Machine, or VPS from a cloud provider. If your host is cloud-instance then the OS
and admin user should already exist. Move on to the provisioning section for further instructions.

If your host is a local machine, perform a clean installation of the operating system using the
following guides:

Ubuntu Hosts:

- Download the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
  [server installer](https://ftp.snt.utwente.nl/pub/os/linux/ubuntu-releases/22.04.3/ubuntu-22.04.3-live-server-amd64.iso)
- [Install Ubuntu 22.04 LTS on a local machine](https://ostechnix.com/install-ubuntu-server/)
