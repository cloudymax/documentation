# Types of Hosts

## Bare-Metal

"Bare Metal" means that your host OS is running directly on a piece of hardware without any
virtulization. This reduces the complexity of deploymnet at the cost of increased time and effort
for re-provisioning the host.

## Virtual Machines

Virtual Machines are a software-defined layer of abstraction atop a Bare-Metal host which makes
deployments more consistent and easier to manage declaratively. This greaty reduces the difficulty
of re-deployment and creates the conditions required for securely running multiple guests within the
same physical host. Virtual Machines can also be used to create hosts that run different operating
systems (Windows, MacOS) or architectures (ARM) than the host machine. This added functionality
comes at the cost of added complexity, a slight performance penalty, and you need to already have a
Bare-Metal host on which to run the VMs.
