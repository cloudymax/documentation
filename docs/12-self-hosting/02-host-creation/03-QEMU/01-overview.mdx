# About QEMU

[QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/documentation/) is an open source machine emulator and virtualizer. It
can be used for **system emulation**, where it provides a virtual model of an entire machine to run
a guest OS or it may work with a another hypervisor like KVM or Xen. QEMU can also provide **user
mode emulation**, where QEMU can launch processes compiled for one CPU on another CPU via emulation.

QEMU is special amongst its counterparts for a couple important reasons:

- Like [ESXi](https://www.vmware.com/nl/products/esxi-and-esx.html), its capable of PCIe-passthrough
  for GPUs
  ([VirtualBox](https://docs.oracle.com/en/virtualization/virtualbox/6.0/user/guestadd-video.html)
  cant help us here)
- Unlike ESXi, it's free
- When used with KVM, QEMU provides near-native levels of performance.
- Can be used inside Kubernetes via [Kubevirt](https://kubevirt.io/)
- It's fast. QEMU can create a new fully-featured VM in seconds. That's not quite as fast as
  [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/),
  [FireCracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/), or
  [Cloud-Hypervisor](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor) (formerly
  [NEMU](https://github.com/intel/nemu)), but its far more mature, featureful, and thoroughly
  documented.
- Unlike a [system container (LDX)](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/) or
  [Multipass](https://multipass.run/docs) it can also create Windows and MacOS guests.
- [Unlike Firecracker](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/issues/849#issuecomment-464731628)
  it supports pinning memmory addresses (and thus PCIe-passthrough) where firecracker cannot because
  it would break their core feature of over-subscription.

These qualities make QEMU well-suited for those seeking a highly-performant ad fully-featured
hypervisor.

## Requirements

- Linux host running Debian12 or Ubuntu 22.04
- VNC viewer software installed on the machien you will use to access the VM
  - [TightVNC](https://www.tightvnc.com/download.php) (Windows)
  - [Remina](https://remmina.org/) (Linux)
  - [TigerVNC](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/tiger-vnc)(MacOS)

## Setup

- Install QEMU and its dependancies

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install -y qemu-kvm \
          bridge-utils \
          virtinst\
          ovmf \
          qemu-utils \
          cloud-image-utils \
          tmux \
          whois \
          git \
          jq \
          git-extras \
          guestfs-tools \
  ```
