# Types of Hosts

## Bare-Metal

"Bare Metal" means that your host OS is running directly on a piece of hardware without any
virtualisation. This reduces the complexity of deployment at the cost of increased time and effort
for re-provisioning the host.

## Virtual Machines

Virtual Machines are a software-defined layer of abstraction atop a Bare-Metal host which makes
deployments more consistent and easier to manage declaratively. This greatly reduces the difficulty
of re-deployment and creates the conditions required for securely running multiple guests within the
same physical host. Virtual Machines can also be used to create hosts that run different operating
systems (Windows, MacOS) or architectures (ARM) than the host machine. This added functionality
comes at the cost of added complexity, a slight performance penalty, and you need to already have a
Bare-Metal host on which to run the VMs.

## Containers

Containers are built on 'cgroups' (control groups), which are a feature of the Linux kernel that
limits monitors, and isolates the resource usage of a collection of processes. This means that
running containers on Linux is very lightweight form of virtualisation. However, on other operating
systems which do not use the Linux kernel, a Linux virtual machine or translation-layer must be
created to run containers. The manner by which each Operating System resolves this issue varies
greatly as shown below. Because of this variance, the self-hosting documentation targets Linux as a
means of avoiding excess complexity.

## Kubernetes (Cloud Runner)

Kubernetes is somewhat of a combination of all other host types. Since it is an API, it must be
installed on an existing host (called a "Node") which is usually either a VM or physical device. A
Kubernetes "Cluster" is usually made up of 3 or more nodes - though you can have as few as one, or
as many 5,000 per cluster.

    <img src={Layer0} width="700" />
  </a>
  <br />
</div>
<br />

Once installed, Kubernetes creates
[standardised interfaces](https://matt-rickard.com/kubernetes-interfaces) to control the hardware &
software components of the underlying nodes (networking, storage, GPUs, CPU cores etc...) as well as
a distributed key-value store which facilitates communication between all nodes in the cluster.

  </a>
  <br />
</div>
<br />

With the underlying hardware abstracted into a generic pool of resources, Kubernetes is then able to
re-compose those assets into isolated environments called "Namespaces" where it deploys
containerised workloads in groups called "Pods". This layer of Kubernetes is very similar to a
typical container host but with many more features for multi-tenancy, security, and life-cycle
management.
