# Advanced Configuration Options

## Port forwarding

By default, the provided QEMU creates VMs inside of a private virtual network through
[SLIRP networking](https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/Networking). In this configuration network
traffic must be forwarded to the VM through the host via opening ports.

- Example where RDP is being forwarded through the host to the VM:

  ```bash
  -netdev user,id=network,hostfwd=tcp::3389-:3389
  ```

- If you need to forward more ports, you may do so by adding another `hostfwd` argument to the
  `-netdev` entry. This may become inconvenient when many ports need to be opened.

  ```bash
  -netdev user,id=network,hostfwd=tcp::3389-:3389,hostfwd=tcp::22-:22,hostfwd=tcp::80-:80
  ```

## Bridged Networks

It is possible to create virtual machines on the host network, however it requires additional
configuration of the host. This is accomplished by:

1. Converting the Host's network device into a bridge.
2. Creating a tap device controlled by the bridge.
3. Allowing IP traffic forwarding over the bridge.
4. Assigning the tap device to the virtual machine.

Be aware that:

- This process is NOT recommended for inexperienced users as performing the steps incorrectly will
  result in a complete loss of network connectivity to the host machine which will require a reboot,
  manual intervention, and potentially require re-imaging the machine.
- Wireless network adapters CANNOT be used as bridge devices.
- Many VPS and cloud-providers such as AWS and Equinix configure their networking in such a manner
  that bridged networking in this way impossible.

Proceed at your own risk.

### Required Info

- Network adapter name

  You will need to find the name of your primary network adapter. This is hard to automate because
  the name will change based on vendor, type of network adapter, and number of PCIe devices attached
  to the host. Use the command `ip a` to show the network devices for your machine:

  ```bash
  1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
      link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
      inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
         valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
      inet6 ::1/128 scope host
         valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
  2: enp0s31f6: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
      link/ether 90:1b:0e:f3:86:e0 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
      inet 192.168.50.101/32 scope global enp0s31f6
         valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
      inet6 2a01:4f8:a0:3383::2/64 scope global
         valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
      inet6 fe80::921b:eff:fef3:86e0/64 scope link
         valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
  ```

  In this example, the primary network adapter is `enp0s31f6`.

- Network adapter's IP address

  The IP address for the network adapter should be listed in the output of `ip a`. In the example
  above it is `192.168.50.101/32`.

- The default gateway

  Use the command `route -n` to display the routing table. The default gateway should be the first
  entry under the 'GATEWAY' header.

  ```bash
  Kernel IP routing table
  Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
  0.0.0.0         192.168.50.1    0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 enp0s31f6
  10.42.0.0       0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 cni0
  10.42.0.0       0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     0      0        0 flannel-wg
  172.17.0.0      0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     0      0        0 docker0
  ```

### Run the Script

You will need to run these steps as a script unless you have physical access to a keyboard for the
host machine, otherwise you will lose connection when the network restarts. Running as a script
prevents this awkward issue. The following commands must be run from the `root` user account.

- Create the script

  ```bash
  export NETWORK_DEVICE=""
  export IP_ADDRESS=""
  export DEFAULT_GATEWAY=""
  export TAP_NUMBER="0"

  /bin/cat << EOF > bridge.sh
  #!/bin/bash -

  # Treat unset variables as an error
  set -o nounset

  # create a bridge
  sudo ip link add br0 type bridge
  sudo ip link set br0 up
  sudo ip link set ${NETWORK_DEVICE} up

  ##########################################################
  # network will drop here unless next steps are automated #
  ##########################################################

  # add the real ethernet interface to the bridge
  sudo ip link set ${NETWORK_DEVICE} master br0

  # remove all ip assignments from real interface
  sudo ip addr flush dev ${NETWORK_DEVICE}

  # give the bridge the real interface's old IP
  sudo ip addr add ${IP_ADDRESS}/24 brd + dev br0

  # add the default GW
  sudo ip route add default via ${DEFAULT_GATEWAY} dev br0

  # add a tap device for the user
  sudo ip tuntap add dev tap${TAP_NUMBER} mode tap user root
  sudo ip link set dev tap${TAP_NUMBER} up

  # attach the tap device tot he bridge.
  sudo ip link set tap${TAP_NUMBER} master br0

  # Enable forwarding
  iptables -F FORWARD
  iptables -I FORWARD -m physdev --physdev-is-bridged -j ACCEPT
  sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

  ##########################
  # troubleshooting tips   #
  ##########################
  #
  # Show bridge status
  # brctl show
  #
  # Show verbose of single item
  # an active process must be attached to a device for it to not be "disabled"
  # brctl showstp br0

  EOF
  ```

- run the script

  ```bash
  sudo bash ./bridge.sh
  ```

- Verify the new bridge using `brctl show` and `ip a`

  ```bash
  brctl show
  bridge name     bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces
  br0             8000.e6f9f3d4d16b       yes             enp0s31f6
                                                          tap0
  docker0         8000.02422e6c0493       no
  ```

### Adjust QEMU command

Since our VM will be making DHCP requests, we should assign it a mac-address.

- Use the following command to generate a MAC address, or make up your own:

  ```bash
  openssl rand -hex 6 | sed 's/\(..\)/\1:/g; s/:$//'
  ```

- Populate the values below with your own, then use them to replace the existing `-device` and
  `-netdev` options in the QEMU command.

  ```bash
  -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=network,mac=$MAC_ADDRESS \
  -netdev tap,id=network,ifname=tap$TAP_NUMBER,script=no,downscript=no \
  ```

## Static IP Assignment

When using a bridged network it is also possible to assign an IP address to your VM prior to
creation. To do this, add a `netplan` configuration file to your Cloud-Init file, as well as a
command to apply the new configuration.

You will need to know the VM's network adapter name ahead of time which may take some trial and
error, but it is generally `enp0s2` unless extra PCI devices are attached to the VM. In which case
the final character may be a higher or lower number. Additionally you will need to know the IP
address for the DNS name-server and default gateway.

- Example:

  ```yaml
  #cloud-config
  hostname: ${VM_NAME}
  fqdn: ${VM_NAME}
  disable_root: false
  network:
    config: disabled
  users:
    - name: ${USERNAME}
      groups: users, admin, docker, sudo
      sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
      shell: /bin/bash
      lock_passwd: false
      passwd: ${PASSWORD}
  write_files:
    - path: /etc/netplan/99-my-new-config.yaml
      permissions: '0644'
      content: |
        network:
          ethernets:
            ${INTERFACE}:
              dhcp4: no
              dhcp6: no
              addresses: [${DESIRED_IP_ADDRESS}/24]
              routes:
                - to: default
                  via: ${DEFAULT_GATEWAY}
              mtu: 1500
              nameservers:
                addresses: [${DNS_SERVER_IP}]
          renderer: networkd
          version: 2
  runcmd:
    ##############################################
    # Apply the new config and remove the old one
    - /usr/sbin/netplan --debug generate
    - /usr/sbin/netplan --debug apply
    - rm /etc/netplan/50*
    ##############################################
    # Give the network adapter time to come online
    - sleep 5
  ```

## GPU Passthrough

### Enabling IOMMU

With QEMU, we are able to pass PCIe devices such as GPUs from the host to the guest using VFIO which
can provide native-level performance. You will need to make sure that
`Intel Virtualization Technology` and `Intel VT-d`, or `IOMMU` are enabled in your BIOS.
Informatiweb.net has some good examples of this process in
[this thread](https://us.informatiweb.net/tutorials/it/bios/enable-iommu-or-vt-d-in-your-bios.html).

- Enable IOMMU

  Enable IOMMU by changing the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` line in your `/etc/default/grub` file to
  the following:

  ```bash
  GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="iommu=pt amd_iommu=on intel_iommu=on"
  ```

- Run `sudo update-grub`

- Reboot the host

### Verify IOMMU Compatibility

Now that IOMMU is enabled we should be able to find devices in the `/sys/kernel/iommu_groups`
directory. Use the following command to check if IOMMU is working. If everything works, the output
will be a number higher than 0. If the output is 0, your system does not support IOMMU.

```bash
sudo find /sys/kernel/iommu_groups/ -type l |grep -c "/sys/kernel/iommu_groups/"
```

### Assign the `vfio-pci` driver

To assign the correct driver to your GPU we will need to download the `driverctl` utility.
Afterwards we will need to locate the PCI bus-ID for our GPU, then use that information with
driverctl to assign the vfio-pci driver.

- Install `driverctl`

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install -y driverctl
  ```

- Get the GPU PCI bus-ID

  The ID you are looking for will be the first value from the left.

  ```bash
  export GPU_BRAND="nvidia"
  lspci |grep -ai ${GPU_BRAND} |grep VGA
  ```

  Output:

  ```bash
  1:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GP104 [GeForce GTX 1080] (rev a1)
  ```

- Assign the driver

  Show available device by running the following command:

  ```bash
  sudo driverctl list-devices
  ```

  Output:

  ```bash
  0000:00:00.0 skl_uncore
  0000:00:01.0 pcieport
  0000:00:14.0 xhci_hcd
  0000:00:14.2 intel_pch_thermal
  0000:00:16.0 (none)
  0000:00:17.0 ahci
  0000:00:1f.0 (none)
  0000:00:1f.2 (none)
  0000:00:1f.4 i801_smbus
  0000:00:1f.6 e1000e
  0000:01:00.0 nvidia
  0000:01:00.1 snd_hda_intel
  ```

  In the example above, we can see that the GPU's Bus ID `1:00.0` is present in the list and that
  the driver currently assigned is `nvidia`. We can also see a second device in the same id-range:
  `01.00.1` which is using an Intel driver. In order for passthrough to work properly, all devices
  in the same id-range must use the `vfio-pci` driver.

  To change the drivers we will run the following:

  ```bash
  sudo driverctl set-override 0000:01:00.0 vfio-pci
  sudo driverctl set-override 0000:01:00.1 vfio-pci
  ```

  Run `sudo driverctl list-devices` again and you should now see the vfio-pci driver in use.

  Output:

  ```bash
  0000:00:00.0 skl_uncore
  0000:00:01.0 pcieport
  0000:00:14.0 xhci_hcd
  0000:00:14.2 intel_pch_thermal
  0000:00:16.0 (none)
  0000:00:17.0 ahci
  0000:00:1f.0 (none)
  0000:00:1f.2 (none)
  0000:00:1f.4 i801_smbus
  0000:00:1f.6 e1000e
  0000:01:00.0 vfio-pci [*]
  0000:01:00.1 vfio-pci [*]
  ```

### Adjust the QEMU command

You are now ready to pass the GPU to your VM by adding a new `-device` option to the QEMU command.

> If you plan to use your VM for full-screen applications then you may need to disable the virtual
> display so that apps will properly choose the display attached to the GPU instead of the RedHat

- Consumer GPUs

  ```bash
  export BUS_ID="1:00.0"
  -device vfio-pci,host=${BUS_ID},multifunction=on,x-vga=on \
  ```

- Data Center GPUs with large amounts of VRAM

  ```bash
  export BUS_ID="1:00.0"
  -device vfio-pci,host=${BUS_ID},multifunction=on -fw_cfg name=opt/ovmf/X-PciMmio64Mb,string=65536 \
  ```

- Nvidia vGPU devices

  ```bash
  export VGPU="/sys/bus/mdev/devices/$VGPU_UUID"
  -device vfio-pci,sysfsdev=${VGPU} -uuid $(uuidgen)
  ```
