# Get Started with QEMU

[QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/documentation/) (short for "Quick Emulator") is a generic and open
source machine emulator and virtualiser.

When used as a machine emulator, QEMU can run OSes and programs made for one machine (e.g. an ARM
board) on a different machine (e.g. your own PC). By using dynamic translation, it achieves very
good performance.

When used as a virtualiser, QEMU achieves near native performance by executing the guest code
directly on the host CPU. QEMU supports virtualisation when executing under the Xen hypervissor or
using the KVM kernel module in Linux. When using KVM, QEMU can virtualise x86, server and embedded
PowerPC, 64-bit POWER, S390, 32-bit and 64-bit ARM, and MIPS guests

## Why use QEMU?

- Like [ESXi](https://www.vmware.com/nl/products/esxi-and-esx.html), its capable of PCIe-passthrough
  for GPUs. This is in contrast with [Firecracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/) and
  [VirtualBox](https://docs.oracle.com/en/virtualization/virtualbox/6.0/user/guestadd-video.html)
  which cannot.
- Unlike ESXi, it's free.
- When used with KVM, QEMU provides near-native levels of performance.
- Can be used inside Kubernetes via [Kubevirt](https://kubevirt.io/)
- It's fast. QEMU can create a new fully-featured VM in seconds. That's not quite as fast as
  [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/),
  [Firecracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/), or
  [Cloud-Hypervisor](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor) (formerly
  [NEMU](https://github.com/intel/nemu)), but its far more mature, has a larger community, and more
  documentation available.
- Unlike a [system container (LDX)](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/) or
  [Multipass](https://multipass.run/docs) it can also create Windows and MacOS guests.
- [Unlike Firecracker](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/issues/849#issuecomment-464731628)
  it supports pinning memory addresses (and thus PCIe-passthrough) where firecracker cannot because
  it would break their core feature of over-subscription.
- Can be run in a micro-vm configuration to achieve a smaller memory footprint (Inspired by
  Firecracker).

These qualities make QEMU well-suited for those seeking a highly-performant and fully-featured
hypervisor.

## Requirements

- Linux host running Debian 12 or Ubuntu 22.04
- VNC viewer software installed on the machine you will use to access the VM
  - [TightVNC](https://www.tightvnc.com/download.php) (Windows)
  - [Remina](https://remmina.org/) (Linux)
  - [TigerVNC](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/tiger-vnc) (MacOS)

## Installation

- Install QEMU and its dependencies

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install -y qemu-kvm \
          bridge-utils \
          virtinst\
          ovmf \
          qemu-utils \
          cloud-image-utils \
          tmux \
          whois \
          git \
          jq \
          git-extras \
          guestfs-tools \
  ```
