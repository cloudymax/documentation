# VMs with Multipass (Basic)

Multipass is a light-weight Virtual Machine Manager for Linux, Windows and MacOS. It's designed for
developers who want to quickly create a fresh Ubuntu environment with a single command. It uses the
native hypervisor for whichever platform it is installed on (KVM on Linux, Hyper-V on Windows and
HyperKit on MacOS) to run VMs with minimal overhead. It can also use VirtualBox on Windows and
MacOS. The biggest limitation of Multipass is that it only creates Ubuntu VMs.

- [Official Github Repo](https://github.com/canonical/multipass)

## Installation

To install multipass on Linux use the commands below.

```bash
sudo apt-get install snapd
sudo snap install core
sudo snap install multipass
```

For installation on Windows and MacOS, refer to the official installation instructions:

- [How to install Multipass on Windows](https://multipass.run/docs/installing-on-windows)
- [How to install Multipass on MacOS](https://multipass.run/docs/installing-on-macos)

## Creating a VM

- Set values

  ```bash
  # The name of the Virtual Machine
  export VM_NAME="gameci"

  # The name of the user to create
  export VM_USER="vmadmin"

  # Number of CPU cores to allocate to the VM
  export VM_CPUS="2"

  # Amount of Disk Space to allocate to the VM.
  # Cannot exceed available on host.
  export VM_DISK="32G"

  # Amount of RAM to allocate to the VM.
  # Cannot exceed available RAM on host.
  export VM_MEM="8G"

  # Set path on MacOS systems
  export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin/multipass"

  # Set path on Linux system
  export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin/multipass"
  ```

- Create a password

  ```bash
  # Install the mkpasswd utility
  sudo apt install -y whois

  read PW_STRING
  export PASSWORD=$(mkpasswd -m sha-512 --rounds=4096 "$PW_STRING" -s "saltsaltlettuce")
  ```

- Create an ssh-key for authenticating with the VM

  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -C $VM_USER -f runner
  ```

- Add the public ssh-key and password to a cloud-init file

  See the [cloud init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/examples.html) official
  docs for more information about cloud-init. More advanced templates are available in the
  [Host Provisioning](../04-host-provisioning/03-cloud-init.mdx) directory.

  ```bash
  VM_KEY=$(cat runner.pub)

  cat << EOF > cloud-init.yaml
  #cloud-config
  groups:
    - docker
  users:
    - default
    - name: ${VM_USER}
      sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
      shell: /bin/bash
      groups: docker, admin, sudo, users
      no_ssh_fingerprints: true
      lock_passwd: false
      passwd: ${PASSWORD}
      ssh-authorized-keys:
        - ${VM_KEY}
  packages:
    - docker.io
  EOF
  ```

- Start the VM

  See the [multipass launch](https://multipass.run/docs/launch-command) command docs for more
  information.

  ```bash
  export VERBOSITY="-vvvvvv"

  /snap/bin/multipass launch --name $VM_NAME \
    --cpus $VM_CPUS \
    --disk $VM_DISK \
    --mem $VM_MEM \
    --cloud-init cloud-init.yaml \
    $VERBOSITY
  ```

- Get the VM's IP address

  ```bash
  VM_IP=$(/snap/bin/multipass list |grep "${VM_NAME}" |awk '{print $3}')
  ```

- Connect to the VM via ssh or cli

  ssh:

  ```bash
  ssh -i runner $VM_USER@$VM_IP -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -vvvv
  ```

  CLI:

  ```bash
  multipass shell $VM_NAME
  ```

- Install the runner application

  - [Gitlab Pipelines](../05-runner-application-installation/01-gitlab-pipelines.mdx)

## Cleanup

```bash
/snap/bin/multipass stop $VM_NAME
/snap/bin/multipass delete $VM_NAME
/snap/bin/multipass purge
```
