The Host is the computer that will execute the runner application. This can be a desktop computer,
laptop, Virtual Machine, or VPS from a cloud provider.

## If your host is a local machine:

For a local machine you will need to perform a clean installation of the operating system. This
means creating a bootable USB drive from an ISO file, booting the machine from the USB drive, and
installing the OS. Links to download an official Live ISO file and installation guides are provided
below. If you would like to create a custom ISO, try [PXEless](https://github.com/cloudymax/pxeless)
or [Cubic](https://github.com/PJ-Singh-001/Cubic).

### Ubuntu

- Download the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
  [server installer](https://ftp.snt.utwente.nl/pub/os/linux/ubuntu-releases/22.04.3/ubuntu-22.04.3-live-server-amd64.iso)
- [Guide: Install Ubuntu 22.04 LTS on a local machine](https://ostechnix.com/install-ubuntu-server/)

### Debian

- Download the Debian 12
  [installation image](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-dvd/debian-12.1.0-amd64-DVD-1.iso)
- [Guide: Install Debian on a local system](https://www.linuxtechi.com/how-to-install-debian-11-bullseye/)

## If your host is a virtual-machine:

If you are using a VPS or VM, the OS should already be installed and admin user should already
exist. Follow the appropriate guide in the provisioning section for your operating-system.
